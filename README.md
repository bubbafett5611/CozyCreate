# Source Control
Use this section as reference when the pack will update, versioning, and source control requirements.

### Versioning
This pack uses Semantic versioning (`Major.Minor.Patch`). Up until now, all changes have been marked as "Patches" however some of them should have been "Minor" updates. I intend to fix this here on out, however I may still make this mistake from time to time. This also means that every update will no longer be marked as "Beta".  

#### Examples:
This is not a comprehensive list of 
- Major
  - Extreme changes to the Pack
  - Initial Release of Pack `1.0.0`
  - Anything Breaking Backwards Compatibility with Worlds
- Minor
  - Major Config Changes
  - Minor Mod Additions or Removals
  - Mod Updates
  - Recipe Changes
- Patch
  - Minor Config Changes
  - Bug Fixes
  - Recipe Additions

### Update Cycle
My goal as a pack developer is to update the pack on a regular basis. This includes making sure everything continues to run smooth as mods release updates. The schedule below is a rough outline of how often to expect updates.

For now there will be no set days for updates. Please be understanding when waiting for updates.
